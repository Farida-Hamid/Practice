# Practice

## [1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/):
Given an array of integer nums and an integer target, I built a function that returns indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target without using the same element twice. I assumed that each input would have exactly one solution.

### Example 1:
    
    Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
    Output: [0,1]
    
### Example 2:
    
    Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
    Output: [1,2]
    
### Example 3:
    
    Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
    Output: [0,1]
