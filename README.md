# Practice

## 1. [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/):
Given an array of integer nums and an integer target, I built a function that returns indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target without using the same element twice. I assumed that each input would have exactly one solution.

#### Example 1:
    Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
    Output: [0,1]
    
#### Example 2:
    Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
    Output: [1,2]
    
#### Example 3:  
    Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
    Output: [0,1]

## 2. [Palindrome Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/):

Given an integer x, I built a function that returns true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same forward and backward. For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.

#### Example 1:
    Input: x = 121
    Output: true
    Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

#### Example 2:
    Input: x = -121
    Output: false
    Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

#### Example 3:
    Input: x = 10
    Output: false
    Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
